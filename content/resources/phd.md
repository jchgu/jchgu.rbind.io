# Resources for PhD Students in Social Sciences

Resources that I find helpful for my PhD journey

## Writing

I can relate to the reflections in [Respect the Marble](https://catherineeunicedevries.substack.com/), 
the Substack of political scientist Catherine E. De Vries:

- Writing is a craft that emerges from practice, not a talent that you are endowed with. 

- When you write in simple, clear prose to explain complex concepts and relations, you truly understand them.

I also follow the practical advice in [Better Academic Research Writing](https://betteracademicwriting.wordpress.com/)
by sociologist Ren√© Bekkers.

Looking for books on academic writing? Try [Academic Writing as if Readers Matter](https://doi.org/10.1353/book.129004)
by Leonard Cassuto. You will find witty examples and clear instructions on what works and what does not.
Alternatively, you can also check [The Sense of Style](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/183573/the-sense-of-style-by-pinker-steven/9780241957714)
by Steven Pinker.
